## 🏗️ Project Overview

This repository contains a **two-service web application** designed as a modern infrastructure and DevOps showcase. The workspace is structured as a monorepo, orchestrated with Docker Compose, and features a clear separation between frontend and backend services.

---

## 🧠 AI Workspace Analysis

### Architecture

- **Frontend:**  
  - Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (TypeScript), located in [`web/`](web/).
  - Uses Tailwind CSS for styling and custom ESLint/Prettier configurations for code quality.
  - Communicates with the backend exclusively via HTTP REST API.
  - Environment variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_FLASK_API_URL` configures the backend API endpoint.

- **Backend:**  
  - Implemented in [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) (Python), located in [`server/`](server/).
  - Uses SQLAlchemy ORM for database access (SQLite by default, with migration plans for MySQL).
  - Provides REST endpoints for authentication, user management, and apartment/tenant operations.
  - Passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt.
  - CORS is enabled for frontend-backend communication.

- **Infrastructure:**  
  - Managed by [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml), which orchestrates both services.
  - Each service has its own Dockerfile for containerization.
  - Persistent storage for the backend is mounted at `server/db/`.

### Individual Components

- **Frontend:**  
  - Main app code in [`web/src/app/`](web/src/app/).
  - Example sub-routes: `/portal`, `/dashboard`, `/tenants`, `/rooms`, `/payments`, `/finance`, `/email`, `/profile`, `/settings`.
  - Linting and formatting scripts are provided in [`web/package.json`](web/package.json).
  - Unit and integration tests are set up with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/), and E2E tests with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/).

- **Backend:**  
  - Main application logic in [`server/main.py`](server/main.py).
  - Dependencies managed via [`server/requirements.txt`](server/requirements.txt) and [`server/pyproject.toml`](server/pyproject.toml).
  - Testing is supported with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/).

- **Documentation:**  
  - Design documents, module guides, and notes are organized under [`doc/`](doc/).
  - Includes conceptual overviews, deployment guides, and QA/testing strategies.

### Infrastructure & DevOps

- **CI/CD:**  
  - GitHub Actions workflows are defined in [`.github/workflows/`](.github/workflows/) for automated linting, formatting, and testing.
- **Containerization:**  
  - Both frontend and backend are containerized for reproducible local and cloud deployments.
- **Quality Assurance:**  
  - Automated and manual QA workflows are documented and partially implemented.
  - Manual code reviews are tracked in markdown files under [`doc/notes/`](doc/notes/).

## 🏢 Fictional Concept: Apartment Tenant Management System (ATMS)

The application is themed as an **Apartment Tenant Management System** for a fictional property, "Fuchsia Leon Residences."  
Key features include:

- **Role-Based Dashboards:** Custom dashboards for admin, staff, finance, and tenants.
- **Tenant Directory:** Card-based UI for managing tenants.
- **Room Management:** Assign and track apartment rooms.
- **Payment & Finance:** Automated billing, payment tracking, and financial analytics.
- **Email Communications:** Built-in tools for tenant notifications and reminders.
- **Profile Management:** Secure user account and session management.
