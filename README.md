## 🏗️ Project Overview

**Qualisync** serves as both a *study* and a *personal application* of integrating multiple IT disciplines. It bridges development-focused areas—such as **fullstack development**, **REST API design**, and **UI/UX engineering**—with operations-oriented practices like **version control**, **quality assurance** (both automated and manual), and **containerization/cloud environments**.

With a background rooted in *software development*, I have spent the past **four years** exploring modern development practices, engaging with industry professionals, and staying current with technological trends. While software development has become more accessible, its relative value has shifted, highlighting the growing importance of **operational expertise** in today’s IT landscape.

This project reflects the *evolving demands* of the industry: developers are now expected to understand not only how to build software, but also how to **manage infrastructure**, **automate processes**, **ensure quality**, and support **continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD)**. Although this project may not encompass every technology or aspect of large-scale industry experience, it is designed to expand my skills beyond development—*deepening my understanding* of software engineering as a whole and preparing me for the challenges of modern IT.

## 🏢 Thicket ATMS for Fuchsia - Qualisync's Fictional Beneficiary 

To fully leverage **version control**, **quality assurance**, **Docker containerization**, and other modern IT practices, this project includes a *(continuously evolving)* web application that serves as both the main client-facing product and a foundation for operational experimentation. **Fuchsia** addresses this need—a web application designed for a *fictional apartment-tenant management system*, inspired by my previous academic and personal projects.

**Fuchsia** acts as a centralized digital hub for *tenants*, *administrators* (apartment owners and staff), and *room management*. It streamlines operations with features such as **role-based access control (RBAC)**, **intuitive UI/UX**, **room and tenant management**, **payment and lease tracking**, and more. The architecture is built on **Next.js** for the frontend, a **Flask API** backend, and **MySQL** for data storage. Supporting technologies include **Vitest** and **Playwright** for testing, **Tailwind CSS** for styling, and **Docker** for containerization. This setup provides a practical environment to explore and apply both development and operations concepts in a real-world-inspired scenario.

## ⏳ Project Duration
This project is intentionally designed as a long-term, evolving effort rather than a short, fixed-scope build. Instead of focusing on rapid, single-purpose development, I aim to continuously expand Qualisync with new features and mini-projects throughout 2026. The flexible timeline allows for deeper exploration of both development and operations, moving beyond my previous development-only projects.
