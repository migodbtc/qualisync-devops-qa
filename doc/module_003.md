#### automated QA
- learn about unit & integration testing in the context of next.js applications
- learn about e2e testing in the context of next.js applications
- install vitest for u&i testing on nextjs (`pnpm add -D vitest ./filter web`)
  - install `@testing-library/react`, `@testing-library/jest-dom`, and `js-dom` as vitest dependencies
  - generate vitest config and setup mock dom file (`setup.ts`)
  - generate sanity check test under `unit/`
- install playwright for integration on nextjs `pnpm add -D @playwright/test --filter ./web`
  - generate sanity check test under `e2e/`
- install pytest for unit testing on flask api `pip install pytest`
- install flask test client (FTC) for integration testing on flask api (preinstalled with Flask)
- install requests (library) for e2e testing for flask api `pip install requests`
- mandatory freeze `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
- use markdown files for manual code review for both flask & nextjs
  - create a viable copy-pastable format that can be used for code reviews
  - automate using a script or something so that u dont have to copy paste, modify file name, manually put in date & time, etc
- write test scenarios for Nextjs
  - unit & integration (vitest)
  - end-to-end (playwright)
  - code review (custom automated migo-style markdowns)
- write test scenarios for Flask API
  - unit (pytest)
  - integration (FTC)
  - end-to-end (requests library)
